# WebDevelopment Analog Clock using Javascript

In this project, I learn many new concepts.
Majorly, I learned about how to move the clock hands with respect of the center of dial using javascript.
I'm using the following formulas for movements of hour,minute and second hands in clock:
1. Hour hand : 360(degree)/12(hours) equals to 30(degree)movement after every hour plus 30(degree)/60(mins.) 
2. Minute hand : 360(degree)/60(mins.) equals to 6(degree) movement after every minute.
3. Second hand : 360(degree)/60(secs.) equals to 6(degree) movement after every second.

   Challenging part is to adjust the hands to move around the dial for which I uses the CSS property called transform.origin which help in revolving the hands around dialer with bottom setting.

   This project helped me in understanding and interpretation of practical use of mathematical concepts like degrees and hour-minute-second conversions and basic formulas.
